#YELP REVIEWS

#Introduction

The analysis below focuses on evaluating customer perceptions regarding the businesses
that provide a service to the population. This type of analysis will help businesses to validate
how the market is behaving in the face of the service provided and thus make decisions that
allow improvement in their processes. Initially, an analysis of the positive and negative words
and the perception of thought will be done. This will help us to validate how the customer
experiences were. Then a comparison will be made regarding the tendency of positive and
negative words as well as the perception of feeling.
In addition, we will enter the length of the reviews in the comparison with the category
granted by the customers, this will help us to verify if there is a certain correlation in said
rating and we will evaluate how the behavior is in terms of a 5-star rating.Finally, we will
observe if there is a relationship between the comments voted useful versus the category
by stress and the length of the reviews so we can delve into the strategies that we should
implement to overcome certain inconveniences.
